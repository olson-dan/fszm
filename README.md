ZMachine V3 in F#

Not finished yet.  Runs up to first input.  I got lazy when it came to implementing the dictionary.

This was an experiment in F#, learning as I go.  I will never write F# in lightweight syntax.

This is the third zmachine I've worked on, but the only one I've made public.  The first shipped commercially as part of Call of Duty: Black Ops.
